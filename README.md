# AnalyticalGeometry

This is a tiny library for analytical geometry tasks. It provides the basics of the analytical geometry for three dimensional
spaces like coordinates, lines and planes. Additionally there are routines for the calculation of projections of points on lines
or planes, shortest distances between each other in space.
